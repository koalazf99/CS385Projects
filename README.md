# CS385Projects
Independent Projects for SJTU CS385 Machine Learning.

To inplement some machine learning method for classification models and generative models.


---------
## Recording something during the project
- Always remember to preprocess the data, otherwise the loss can be nan
- Design util function which can be re-used from time to time(to save some time 👀👀)
- It is mentioned that no tool packages should be used here, so remember to implement usable function on your own!


----
## Task Lists
- ☑️ SVM (sklearn package) 5.5
- ☑️ Logistic Regression(without using package) 5.10
- LDA
- PCA
- small NN(MLP)
- Logistic Regression + Ridge Loss/Lasso Loss
- Kernel Base Regression + Lasso Loss
- Gaussian Mixture Model(EM model)
- simple CNN
- simple RNN

## Exploring and extending experiments
**Stay tuned**
